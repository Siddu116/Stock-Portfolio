# Stock-Portfolio
Stock Portfolio Manager (Developed in Python)
The stock portfolio manager is a Python-based application designed to help users track and manage their investments in stocks. It allows users to monitor stock performance, calculate returns, and make informed decisions based on real-time or historical data.

Key Features:
Portfolio Tracking: Users can input the stocks they own along with the number of shares and purchase price. The application keeps track of the portfolio's value.
Stock Price Retrieval: Using APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage, the program fetches real-time stock prices and updates the portfolio's performance.
Profit/Loss Calculation: Automatically calculates the gains or losses based on current market prices compared to the buying price.
Visualizations: With libraries like matplotlib or seaborn, the program can display stock trends, portfolio distribution, and performance over time.
Technologies & Language:
The project is built using Python, leveraging the following libraries:

pandas for handling and analyzing stock data.
yfinance or other APIs for fetching live stock data.
matplotlib or seaborn for visualizing stock performance.
numpy for calculations related to stock price movements and returns.
Pythonâ€™s powerful data handling and easy integration with financial APIs make it a great tool for building a stock portfolio manager.
